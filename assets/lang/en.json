    "project_overview": "Project Overview",
    "project_1_overview": "This project covers the electric vehicle development process within the scope of an international efficiency competition. In the project, I optimized the vehicle's motor parameters by performing regression analyses with Python. I carried out detailed motor simulations using engineering tools such as ANSYS Maxwell and RMxprt. To strengthen the team's corporate identity, I designed and launched a website at magecarla.com and organized internal communication systems. I also established a professional communication infrastructure by creating corporate email addresses for team members (e.g., berkay@magecarla.com).",
    "project_2_overview": "Within the scope of this project, I developed a special GPT model that provides detailed explanations about electronic components. The model is designed as a reliable and comprehensive information source, especially for electronic engineering students and professionals in the field. By providing fast, accurate, and understandable information about electronic components, it aims to facilitate learning processes and support technical research.",
    "project_3_overview": "In this independent project, I developed the interface and analysis components of a Python-based image processing application that uses the Otsu thresholding algorithm to detect Schottky surfaces. I also designed an analysis system that automatically receives measurement data from the Keithley2400 device, performs calculations on this data, and visualizes the results with graphs. The project enables faster and more accurate evaluation of experimental data by combining image processing and automatic data analysis capabilities.",
    "project_4_overview": "In this project, I developed an AI-based system for personalized drug design by analyzing patient data. I used RDKit for chemical structure analysis, regression models for drug efficacy predictions, and tools such as BioBERT and Gemini for biomedical text interpretation. This work demonstrates the potential of AI in medical technologies and provides an important step towards the development of personalized treatment approaches.",
    "project_5_overview": "This project is an interactive web game where users create different shapes by connecting stars that appear on the screen. Users reveal constellations by connecting stars of the same color with lines. The game appeals to users of all ages with its simple and fun interface.",
    "project_6_overview": "This mini drawing application offers users a simple and enjoyable digital drawing experience. Using the power of modern web technologies, it allows visitors to express their creativity and download their artwork with just a few clicks. Equipped with basic tools such as color selection, brush size adjustment, and clearing, this application appeals to users of all ages.",
    "project_7_overview": "This Wordle game is a personalized version of the original popular word guessing game. You try to guess 5-letter words in up to 6 attempts. After each guess, you receive colored clues that show whether the letters are correct and in the right position. Green tiles indicate that the letter is correct and in the right place, yellow tiles indicate that the letter is correct but in the wrong place, and black tiles indicate that the letter is not in the word.",
